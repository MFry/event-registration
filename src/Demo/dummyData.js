Here is what some people have to say about Emily's workshops:<br />
<br />
This was one of the best dance workshops I have been too. Great followers. Great instructors.<br />
Mark Susol, Cupertino, CA<br />
<br />
I've often felt intimidated by the slow learning curve I experience with tango. Emily’s classes give me enough information to jump in while still developing my technique + proper mechanics. I feel so much more confident in my tango and it’s been a really fun embellishment when I dance fusion. <br />
<br />
Emily is very knowledgeable and is able to convey both the leader and follower's steps. She guides you through each sequence, and allows you to connect with your dance partner naturally. I would take another one of her classes in a heartbeat!<br />
<br />
